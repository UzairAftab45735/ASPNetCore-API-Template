# ASPNetCore-API-Template

This repository contains a basic template for an ASP.NET Core Web API. Inside, you'll find examples of various types of APIs, including:


GET: Retrieve data from the server.

POST: Submit data to the server.

PUT: Update existing data on the server.

DELETE: Remove data from the server.


Each API demonstrates different parameter configurations, including query parameters and request bodies, providing a comprehensive starting point for building RESTful services.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this template for your own projects!
